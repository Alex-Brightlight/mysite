    Tea: Hot Water, Improved <span class="post-date">[August 22, 2025]</span>
  </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>There were few things Dr. Chef enjoyed more than a cup of tea. He made tea for the crew every day at breakfast time, of course, but that involved an impersonal heap of leaves dumped into a clunky dispenser. A solitary cup of tea required more care, a blend carefully chosen to match his day. He found the ritual of it quite calming: heating the water, measuring the crisp leaves and curls of dried fruit into the tiny basket, gently brushing the excess away with his fingerpads, watching color rise through water like smoke as it brewed. Tea was a moody drink.</p>

<p>I love how the book pauses for moments like these—for something as small as tea. A spaceship is hurtling through the galaxy, but the detail that lingers is a cup of leaves in steeping hot water. I think of this scene when making tea. Lately, jasmine or herbal instead of more coffee. I’d like to call it a ritual, though Dr Chef would shake his head at a bag and mug. Still, there is choosing, and there is a pause to watch colours spreading through water. Perhaps ritual begins there—with awareness.</p>

<p>I could be happy being in charge of food and plants on this ship. Tea to start the day. A blend for the mood. I imagine his cabinet: little wooden drawers filled with dried leaves and flowers. An apothecary. I ponder the history of tea. How many hundreds of years have people been improving hot water with what they had near to hand—rosehips, mint, chamomile? Which blends have we inherited from tradition and which from a marketing department? We call all of it “tea”. What did we call it before?</p>
